# README for Homework 12: Travelling Salesperson Problem (Part 4)
This homework was done by me (Tunc Kose) alone.

### Parameters:
* num_iter = 2.000.000
* pop_size = 1000
* mut_rate = .7
* nthread = 2

My best result was 5653.49, and in the few trials I have run with different parameters, increasing nthread from 1 to 2 has approximately halved the runtime.
