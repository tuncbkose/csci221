Tunc:
I mainly used the debugger in HW6 instead of this assignment, because the main problem I encountered here was infinite loops. 
From that experience I can say that it was very helpful to see what is happening and print different variables to check their condition,
especially when I realized that I should use 'next' sometimes instead of 'step'.
